👋 Hi, I’m @nonoykho
👀 I’m interested in exploring various facets of web development, from front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to back-end frameworks such as Node.js and Express.

🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of web development, focusing on building responsive and interactive user interfaces. I'm also diving into server-side programming and database management.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that align with my interests in web development. I'm eager to work with fellow beginners and experienced developers to enhance my skills and contribute to meaningful projects.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to send me an email at noyskie246@gmail.com.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I love experimenting with new programming languages and technologies. Outside of coding, I enjoy motorcycling and exploring nature trails.
